# Welcome to Sage's Resume

# About me
My name is Sage Ren. I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley, studying Data Science, class of 2023. I am passionate about the intersection of **art and technology**, specifically **generative art and computer vision**. A fun fact about me is that I make **machine learning** generated AI Art and sell them as **NFTs**.

## Research and Work Experience
### Ancient World Citation Analysis (2021-present)
- Collabrated with peers and converted jupyter notebooks into machine learning **web apps**: https://share.streamlit.io/umbravenus/streamlit/main/first_app.py
- Publised **Jupyter book** for Ancient World Citation Analysis: 
- Built **Optical Character Recognition** Model using Pytesseract.
- Optimized Text Summarization and Paraphrasing using **BERT** model.
- Configuring **image segmentation** tools for Ancient Artifacts.
- *Result: Helped lab deployed machine learning models, finetuned them, and accelerated the milestones of projects.*

### DSA Stroke Classification and Segmentation (2020-Present)
- Finetuning **image segmentation** to layout areas of brain where blood flow is lacking or will be lacking.
- Building **image classification** tool to predict whether or not the patient need surgeries.
- Working with 100 scholars and peers with **data labelling** tool to ease daily workload.
- *Result: Enabled third-world country with less advanced equipments to use machine leanring to their advantage,* **patent pending.**
### Software Development intern
#### PropM, Portland, Oregon(Jan 2019 - Sep 2020)
- Took over the **communication** with the company contractor and gradually moved all development from contracting to in-house development.
- Automated Salesforce customization for invoicing, and various daily tasks and cutting the companyâ€™s manual labor time by half, improving the profits by **one-fourth**.
- Left the company to pursue systematic Data Science and Computer Science Education to further my purpose in art and technology
### Organizer/Founder
#### MuseFinder, San Diego, California(Jan 2017 - Dec 2019)
- Hosted events for around 500 artists to create a platform that connects artists together, with the goal of having artworks notarized by **blockchain** eventually.
- Able to **gain profits** through events and gathered around 200 Interviews and numerous data from artists. The events were put on pause after I went back to school for Data Science.

### Daily Art Recommendation
Where the page automatically pulls the daily recommended artwork from API in real-time, then the user can choose their favorite artwork, followed by more artworks from the same artist that the user just chose.
### Neural Art Style Transfer
Using Machine Learning Module to apply different art styles, such as Starry Night to Monalisa, to artwork.
### Deep Dream Filter
Using Machine Learning Module to apply deep dream filter to artwork.
