# Welcome to Sage's Portfolio
# About me
My name is Sage Ren. I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley, studying Data Science.
## My Purpose
### Art and Technology
I am passionate about art and technology. I was denied the opportunity to become an artist by my father, with him quoting the “starving artist” phenomenon when I was 14 years old. Ever since then, I am determined to solve this issue so that no future generation would be denied their artistic dream purely because of monetary problems. With the advancement of computer vision, extended reality, and machine learning, alongside time and experience, I firmly believe that such a solution to the “starving artist” lies in the intersection of art and technology.
### Research
Innovation must happen for the problem of “starving artists” to disappear. There is a reason why such a phenomenon exists for most artists, and without some form of breakthrough, such bleak reality will continue to exist. I want to devote myself to the research of such innovation, be it computer vision, extended reality, or artificial intelligence. With hard work and resilience, I will contribute to such innovation.
### Startup
During my leave from Berkeley, I tried my hands at founding my own startup. I interviewed about 200 artists, asking them what’s their biggest issue and how can I help. The most common ones I get are the following:
1.Piracy Issue
2.Connection with other artists
3.Monetary Issue
I plan to use my knowledge from research to continue to explore and help to solve these problems and more.
## My Skills and Values
Python, C++, Swift, Web Development, iOS development, knowledge of startup, knowledge of art
## Guides to this Portfolio
### Text to Music And Art Generator
Where the user inputs a keyword, and then we use table manipulation as well as search from API to generate art and music.
### Daily Art Recommendation
Where the page automatically pulls the daily recommended artwork from API in real-time, then the user can choose their favorite artwork, followed by more artworks from the same artist that the user just chose.
### Neural Art Style Transfer
Using Machine Learning Module to apply different art styles, such as Starry Night to Monalisa, to artwork.
### Deep Dream Filter
Using Machine Learning Module to apply deep dream filter to artwork.
